SKY130-HS RocketTile Data
2024-01-15  by Donghyeon Koh and W. Rhett Davis, NC State University

The netlist dataset consists of 12 of the Superblue circuits from (Viswanathan et al., 2011, 2012), including Superblue1,2,3,5,6,7,9,11,14,16,18 and 19. The size of these netlists range from 400K to 1.3M nodes, with similar number of nets. More details of designs can be found in paper and appendix.
These netlist files were generated with physical design of the Rocket-Chip generator [link](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip) for the Skywater 130nm process and High-Speed standard-cell library (sky130hs).  The default configuration of the Rocket-Chip was used, and physical design was performed for the RocketTile module. Dummy memories were generated with a similar interface
to the OpenRAM single-port SRAM.
The database-units-to-user-units (DBUtoUU) conversion factor for this dataset is 1000.  Integer dimensions should be divided by this factor to get real dimensions in microns.
The file settings.csv contains the following settings for each variant:
CORE_UTILIZATION   - initial ratio of cell area to core area 
MAX_ROUTING_LAYER  - maximum allowed layer for routing (complete list
                     of layers is in counter_congestion.npz 'layerList')
CLK_PER            - clock period constraint (i.e. target) in units of ns
MAX_CLK_TRANS      - maximum allowed transition time for a clock node,
                     in units of ns.  These are currently set at 500 ns
					 for all variants, which is effectively unconstrained.
CLK_UNCERTAINTY    - clock uncertainty (currently 0.2 ns for all variants)
FLOW_STAGE         - Design flow stage at which the data was generated

There are 6 other settings relating to the layout of the power distribution network, but these are fixed for all variants and can be ignored for now: HSTRAP_LAYER, HSTRAP_WIDTH, HSTRAP_PITCH, VSTRAP_LAYER, VSTRAP_WIDTH, and VSTRAP_PITCH

Each flow-stage has time-stamps for the beginning and end of execution, labeled "begin_time" and "end_time".  These time-stamps were created with "date +%s" and give seconds since 1970-01-01 UTC.
			
There are 8 additional outcomes/labels available for for each flow-stage after "init_design", each calculated at the end of the stage:
wnhs                  - worst negative hold-slack for any register input,
                        in units of ns
tnhs                  - total negative hold-slack, summed for all register 
                        inputs, in units of ns
nhve                  - number of hold-violation enpoints, i.e. the number 
                        of register inputs with negative hold slack.
ntv                   - number of total violations of a maximum transition-
                        time setting on any net
critpath              - critical-path delay in units of ns		
max_clk_trans_out     - maximum transition time for any clock node, 
                        in units of ns
area_cell             - cell area in units of square microns
core_utilization_out  - ratio of cell area to core area

### Processed Data:
We used PyTorch-geometric (pyg) (Fey and Lenssen, 2019) to construct the dataset and data objects. 
Depending on the models is a Graph Neural Network or a (directed) Hypergraph Neural Network, each netlist circuit from the Raw Data will be represented as a bipartite-graph or (directed) hypergraph using pyg. 

Features:
    - Cell/Node Features:
        - Type (int): Master library cell ID (array index).
        - Orient (int): Orientation of a cell.
        - Width, Height (float): Width and height of a cell.
        - Cell Degree (int): The degree of a cell.
        - Degree Distribution (list[int]): Degree distribution of a local neighborhood. 
        - Laplacian Eigenvector (list[float]): Top-10 Laplacian Eigenvector. 
        - PD (list[float]): Persistent diagram features.
   - Net/(Hyper)edge Feature:
        - Net Degree (int): The degree of a net. 

Targets:
    - Net-based Wirelength Regression: Half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) as a common estimate of wirelength. 
    - Net-based Demand Regression: Demand of each net, congestion happens when demand exceeds capacity. 
    - Cell-based Congestion Classification: Similar to (Yang et al., 2022) and (Wang et al., 2022), we classify the cell-based congestion values (computed as the ratio of cell demand/cell capacity) into (a) [0,0.9], not-congested ; and (b) [0.9, inf]; congested.

all the files corresponding to each design are expressed as 
"index.{file_name}.pkl"
**Notice that, index is not a design number.** If one needs the map from index to design number, please load the Python dictionary file:
```python
import pickle

with open("2023-03-06_data/all.idx_to_design.pkl", "rb") as f:
    dict = pickle.load(f)
```
